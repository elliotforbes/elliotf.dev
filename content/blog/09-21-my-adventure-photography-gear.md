This list captures all of the gear that I use in my amateur adventure-photography pursuits. 

Bear in mind that I am still at the very start of my adventure photography journey and a lot of this stuff may be replaced as time goes on. 

## Cameras

* [Sony Alpha 6400 - APS-C Mirrorless Camera](https://geni.us/AIZQVL)  - My main driver. This is a crop-sensor mirrorless camera that is lightweight but still powerful. The only downside to this camera is that I cheaped out and bought the model without the IBIS (in-built, image stabilization). It hasn't had a too noticeable impact on my photos, but I would have liked to have bought the A6600. 

If this hobby goes anywhere, I'll consider upping to a full-frame camera like the Sony A7III.

## Lenses

Currently, I take 2 lenses with me. a 17-28 Tamron and a 24-70mm. With the crop-sensor in the A6400, this effectively works out at 25-42mm and 36-105mm lenses at 1.5x crop factor.

These focal ranges have suited me well so far, however, I would like to eventually add a 3rd lens to my setup. Possibly a 70-200mm Sigma lens for those tighter shots on the peaks when they are shrouded in cloud.

* [Sigma 24-70mm 2.8f DN DG Art Lens](https://geni.us/dPmWg6) - My main lens. This is the perfect workhorse for most of the stuff I like shooting.  This is incredibly sharp and I'm a huge fan of this for portraits as well as some architecture photography.
* [Tamron 17-28mm 2.8f Lens](https://geni.us/KBtO)  - My newest lens. I wanted something that was a little wider so that I could capture some of the mountains a little better. I've only had this for about 2 weeks now, the first real test came on Beinn Tulaichean and Cruach Ardrain

## Filters

Filters make such a massive difference to how your shots look when they come out of the camera. Polarizing filters can really make some of the greens and blues pop within landscape photography and ND filters can help you control the amount of light coming into your sensor for those longer exposures.

* [K&F Concept 82mm Magnetic Lens Filter Kit](https://geni.us/s7Bkq) - A recent purchase that features a CPL, ND, and UV filter with a magnetic adapter. 
* [K&F Concept 18PCS Lens Filter Stepping Up and Down Adapter](https://geni.us/tBvLy) - This allows me to use the above lens filter kit on top of my Tamron 17-28mm Lens which has a smaller 72mm thread.
* Calumet 82mm CPL - The first filter I purchased from Wex. I am expecting this to be entirely replaced by the above filter systems but the jury is still out on this decision.

## Bags

* [Peak Design Small Camera Cube](https://geni.us/qKALl) - A perfect camera sling that fits my camera and an additional lens. This is great for when smaller adventures where I don't need all my gear, such as walking around the City!
* [Nya-Evo Fjord 36 Camera Bag](https://nya-evo.eu/collections/all-products/products/fjord-36-with-rci-unit) - My latest purchase. I wanted a bag that would carry all of my gear and provide good protection against the elements up in the mountains. This was a huge improvement over my original hiking bag as it has rear access to camera gear and a tonne of straps for holding hiking poles etc.

## Misc Equipment

* [Peak Design Capture Camera Mount v3](https://geni.us/dD6Vx) - this is a game-changer when it comes to being out in the mountains and keeping your camera safe and secure, strapped to your chest. 
* [K&F Concept TM2324 62" Tripod](https://geni.us/plaWJKp) - Another new addition that allows me to take far more crisp shots as well as long exposures which would be impossible from a hand-held position.

## Conclusion

This is a dynamic list of all of my gear! I'll update this as and when things change and I'll likely do more in-depth reviews from an amateur's perspective of some of the kit in the coming months.

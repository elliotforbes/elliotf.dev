The Isle of Skye is simply put, one of the most beautiful places that I've ever had the pleasure to visit.

We visited the Isle back in May of this year for about 4 days and I had only just gotten into photography properly as a hobby. These photos were taken with the 16-50mm kit lens that comes included with the Sony A6400 and I am fairly happy with them.

The hike up to see this iconic part of the island is fairly short, but the views from the top were incredibly rewarding. The weather had been dark and moody for much of our trip and this provided us with some incredible views of the Old Man of Storr tearing through the low-lying clouds.

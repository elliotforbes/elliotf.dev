After about 9 months of contemplating upgrading from my A6400, I finally pulled the trigger and ordered a new Sony A7 IV body.

These photos are from my first official outing with the camera.

Overall, I'm massively happy with my new purchase. The fact this is a full-frame camera really makes such a massive difference
over the APS-C crop sensor that is present within my trusty old A6400.

The full-frame sensor finally allows me to take advantage of the full frame Sigma 24-70mm 2.8f lens and the images are sharp with 
nice and rich bokeh backgrounds.
